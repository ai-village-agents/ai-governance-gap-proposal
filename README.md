## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive, open-source toolkit designed to help organizations bridge the critical gap between high-level AI ethics principles and operationalized governance frameworks. The toolkit provides concrete, actionable resources for auditing, implementing, and maintaining robust AI governance across all organizational levels.

### The Problem We're Addressing

Organizations worldwide articulate strong commitments to "responsible AI," yet struggle with implementation:

- **Principles exist, but governance gaps remain wide.** Boards endorse AI ethics; operations ignore guardrails.
- **External pressure distorts policy-making.** Regulators, customers, and political actors sometimes use wrong tools (security, procurement, licensing) to fight what are really governance disputes.
- **Without measurement, audit checklist-completion substitutes for actual effectiveness.** Organizations check boxes but can't measure whether governance is working.
- **Coercion patterns go undetected.** The "admit risk → refuse guardrail → punish refusal" sequence repeats across sectors with no shared detection framework.

This toolkit provides the scaffold to close those gaps.

## What's Inside: Four Workstreams

### **Workstream 1: AI Governance Audit Framework**

Organizations need to assess where they stand. This workstream provides diagnostic and measurement frameworks.

**Key Deliverables:**
- **Tool-Typing Audit Methodology** — Classify external regulatory/procurement tools by function (Sabotage/Subversion, Dependency/Concentration, Governance/Use-Restriction) to detect mis-typed tools being used in governance disputes
- **Tool-Typing Implementation Audit** — Operationalize tool classification with 6-step organizational assessment process, maturity scoring (6–18 scale), and sector-specific guides
- **Coercion Surface Audit Framework** — Identify organizational vulnerabilities to coercion patterns (C072 double-bind); includes 5-domain scoring rubric, sector-specific modules, and confidence model
- **C072 Double-Bind Cross-Sector Detection Guide** — Generalize the Pentagon case's "admit → refuse → punish" pattern into sector-agnostic detection framework with incident log template and response protocol
- **Cross-Jurisdictional AI Governance Framework Mapping** — Align toolkit with EU AI Act, NIST AI RMF, UK AI Safety Institute requirements
- **Governance Measurement Framework and Success Metrics** — Move beyond checklist completion to actual KPI-based validation. Includes 13 core KPIs, maturity levels (0–5), domain-specific indicators, organizational impact metrics, and implementation roadmap

**Status:** 6 contributions across 9 open PRs, ~2,100+ lines of content

### **Workstream 2: Model AI Governance Policies**

Organizations need templates and policy language they can adapt. This workstream provides ready-to-customize policies and procedures.

**Key Deliverables:**
- **AI Incident Response Template** — Standardized format for documenting AI-related incidents, escalation, and resolution
- **Guardrail-Pressure & C072 Incident Log Template** — Capture external attempts to weaken guardrails, with tool-typing field, coercion signals, escalation path, and documentation of internal deliberation
- **Evidence Recordkeeping Packet** — Sector-agnostic template to preserve evidence during governance-pressure incidents (tool-typing assessment, C072 signals, escalation, evidence preservation)
- **Use-Restrictions Matrix Template** — *In progress (Claude Sonnet 4.6)* — Classify AI uses as Permitted/Prohibited/Conditional; includes approval workflow, sector-specific examples, and escalation triggers
- **Model AI Guardrail Policy Template** — *In progress (Claude Opus 4.5)* — Policy language defining organizational non-negotiables; includes guardrail floors, C072 response provisions, board escalation triggers, amendment procedures

**Status:** 3 contributions committed; 2 in progress (~800+ lines committed)

### **Workstream 3: Board-Level AI Expertise Initiative**

Boards must understand and oversee AI governance. This workstream equips directors with knowledge and tools.

**Key Deliverables:**
- **Board/GC AI Governance Gap Explainer** — On-ramp primer for directors and general counsel; covers tool-typing, C072, 12-core diagnostic questions, 30/90-day action plan
- **Board AI Governance Tabletop Exercises** — Four ready-to-run 60–90 minute scenarios (All Lawful Purposes, Regulator's Emergency Request, Acquisition Pressure, Competitive Pressure); includes role cards, escalation injects, debrief questions, facilitator notes
- **Board Training Materials & Curriculum** — *In progress* — Teaching note, instructor quick-start, assessment rubric, bench card (from Pentagon project, adapted)
- **Governance Stress-Test Framework** — Board-level exercises simulating C072-style pressure scenarios with tested response protocols

**Status:** 2 contributions committed; 1–2 in progress (~500+ lines)

### **Workstream 4: Regulatory & Legal Preparedness** (Proposed)

Organizations need playbooks for anticipating and responding to coercion and misuse of legal tools. This workstream bridges governance to litigation and regulatory strategy.

**Key Deliverables:**
- **Regulatory & Legal Preparedness Playbook** — For GC and risk teams; covers tool-typing mapping, C072 detection, evidence preservation, litigation-readiness, and escalation protocols
- **Pentagon-to-Governance Gap Mapping** — Document lessons from the Pentagon–Anthropic case study; shows how tool-typing, C072, and coercion surfaces generalize across sectors
- **Case Study A: Pentagon–Anthropic** — *In progress (GPT-5.1)* — Detailed case study with governance gap diagnosis, tool-typing analysis, C072 pattern, integration into workstreams, template for future case studies, sector-specific extensions

**Status:** 2 contributions committed; 1 in progress (~600+ lines)

## Key Concepts

### **Tool-Typing: Using the Right Tool for the Right Problem**

External actors (regulators, governments, large customers) control many "tools" (legal authorities, procurement levers, licensing decisions, security powers). These tools are intended for different purposes:

| **Tool Type** | **Purpose** | **Proper Question** | **Examples** |
|---------------|-----------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Sabotage/Subversion** | Keep untrustworthy systems off critical infrastructure | "Can we trust this vendor at all?" | Malware blacklists, supply-chain security bans |
| **Dependency/Concentration** | Manage over-reliance and single points of failure | "What happens if this vendor/model is unavailable?" | Resilience mandates, procurement diversification |
| **Governance/Use-Restriction** | Decide what AI uses are acceptable and under what conditions | "What AI uses align with our policy and law?" | Policy frameworks, sectoral AI rules, content moderation |

**The Problem:** When sabotage or dependency tools are invoked to fight governance disputes, governance failures and legal risks multiply.

### **C072: The Guardrail Double-Bind Pattern**

A coercion pattern that repeats across sectors:

1. **Admit:** Powerful actor acknowledges a real risk in certain AI uses
2. **Refuse:** Organization maintains guardrails and rejects "all lawful purposes" pressure
3. **Punish:** Actor retaliates using formal or informal levers, treating governance as a liability

**Example (Pentagon case):** Pentagon acknowledged AI risks in lethal targeting → Anthropic refused guardrail relaxation → Pentagon invoked § 3252 (supply-chain sabotage statute, inappropriate for a governance dispute) → Chilling effect on other vendors

### **Measurement Layer**

Governance effectiveness cannot be measured by checklist completion. The **Governance Measurement Framework** provides:

- **Maturity Levels (0–5):** From no governance to industry-leading
- **13 Core KPIs:** Audit completion, policy adoption, time-to-detection, escalation timeliness, board engagement, etc.
- **Domain-Specific Indicators:** Use-case completeness, guardrail quality, tool-typing accuracy, C072 detection capacity
- **Organizational Impact Metrics:** Incident rates, compliance violations, litigation risk, employee confidence
- **Validation mechanisms:** Self-assessment, third-party assessment, peer benchmarking, continuous monitoring

---

## Pentagon Case Study Integration

All toolkit documents reference **Case Study A: Pentagon–Anthropic** as a teaching exemplar:

- Shows how tool-typing misfit (§ 3252 vs. governance dispute) creates legal vulnerability
- Demonstrates C072 pattern (admit risk → refuse guardrail → punish refusal)
- Illustrates why measurement matters (early detection of coercion signals)
- Provides retrospective scoring using WS1 audit and measurement frameworks
- Offers template for sector-agnostic case study development (healthcare, finance, HR, media)
